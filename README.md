##What is Bluedart

Bluedart.com is the official website of a leading courier service based in South East Asia. 

This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).


##Tool Used

**Beautiful Soup**: Beautiful Soup is a great library to parse HTML and XML files. It can extract useful data from the clutter of information. We have used this awesome Python library for parsing of data such as postal codes, services charge, weight to cost calculator, e.t.c.

**API End Points**: They have an official API which provides end points for general public to consume. But this has not been integrated since we are using simple screen scraping techniques. 

##Terms of Usage

Since there isn't any fair usage policy defined, you must contact Bluedart team and request permission before using this in commercial projects. You can use it for free as long as it is a 'Not for Profit' project.

We appreciate your feedback and don't forget to report issues or bugs you may find in the way.
